### Q. What is stable algorithm?
A stable algorithm, in the context of sorting, refers to an algorithm that preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys during the sorting process. In other words, if two elements have the same value, their order in the original sequence is maintained in the sorted sequence.
#### Example:
Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Binary Tree Sort etc.


### Q. What is stable algorithm?
An unstable sorting algorithm is one in which the relative order of elements with equal keys may change during the sorting process. 
#### Example:
QuickSort, Heap Sort, and Selection sort etc.

### Q.What is an in-place sort? Is bubble sort an in-place sort?

An in-place sort is a sorting algorithm that rearranges the elements within the given array without requiring any additional memory or creating a new copy of the array. The sorting is performed directly on the input array itself.

Bubble sort is an example of an in-place sorting algorithm. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, gradually moving the larger elements towards the end of the array. Bubble sort operates in-place because it does not require additional memory to perform the sorting. The elements are sorted within the original array without creating a new copy.


### Q.what is adaptable sort?
An adaptable sort, also known as an adaptive sort, is a sorting algorithm that can take advantage of pre-existing order or partially sorted data to improve its performance. It adjusts its strategy based on the input data characteristics, which can lead to faster sorting times in certain cases.

Adaptable sorting algorithms typically have different behavior depending on the input data. They may switch to a more efficient sorting strategy when encountering partially sorted data, reducing the number of comparisons and swaps needed to sort the elements.

#### Some examples of adaptable sorting algorithms include Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, and Adaptive Merge Sort. These algorithms can exhibit better performance on partially sorted or nearly sorted input, making them suitable for scenarios where data tends to have some degree of order

### Sorting Algorithm---->when we should use Scenario
Selection Sort:	Small datasets or partially sorted arrays

Bubble Sort: Small datasets or partially sorted arrays

Insertion Sort:	Small datasets or partially sorted arrays

Merge Sort:	Large datasets, stability requirement

Quick Sort:	Large datasets, average-case efficiency

Heap Sort: Large datasets, space efficiency

Counting Sort: Integer datasets with limited range

Radix Sort:Integer datasets with fixed number of digits



### Sorting Algorithm---->Worst-Case Scenario
Selection Sort:	Any dataset


Bubble Sort:	Any dataset

Insertion Sort:	Any dataset

Merge Sort:	No worst-case scenario (always performs efficiently)

Quick Sort:	Already sorted dataset or a dataset with many duplicate values

Heap Sort:	No worst-case scenario (always performs efficiently)

Counting Sort:Large range of input values or large dataset size

Radix Sort:	Large number of digits in the input values or large dataset size

### Q. Main Differences between String & char array:

#### 1. Size and Flexibility:

 Character arrays have a fixed size, determined at the time of declaration, while strings can dynamically adjust their size as needed.

#### 2. Null Termination:

 Character arrays require a null character ('\0') at the end to mark the end of the string, while strings handle the end of the string automatically.

#### 3. Memory Management:

 Strings manage memory allocation and deallocation automatically, whereas character arrays require manual memory management.

#### 4. String Manipulation:

 Strings provide a range of built-in functions for string manipulation, making it easier to perform operations like concatenation, substring extraction, etc. Character arrays require explicit coding to perform these operations.
 
In summary, character arrays are more low-level and require manual memory management, while strings provide higher-level abstractions and convenient functions for string manipulation.
